# TODO

- Add shop/equipment interface (coin cost shown if not yet purchased)
- Store/pull needs from Firebase
- Cron job adds needs from time to time
- Show how many total hats collected
- Store which hats are purchased

# Features for MVP

- Separate head sprite from body sprite so that head can wag
- Lambs dance (wag their heads) when happy
- Shop to spend coins on tail attachments and hats
- Heart means pet, music means music, apple means hungry, thermometer means sick, sad face means bored

# Stretch ideas

- Re-add lamb behavior state machines
- Add objects in field with drop zones
- Let the lambs play together
- Add different backgrounds
- Store additional game state in Firebase
- Run cron jobs in Firebase Functions to update lamb stats
- Make nearest hungry lamb seek food when dropped
